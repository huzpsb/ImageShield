IMPORTANT NOTICES:
1. This software is designed to protect digital illustrations from unauthorized AI training usage
2. You must own the copyright to any images you process with this tool
3. All processed images must be clearly marked as "Not for AI Training"

USAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Working directory must not contain spaces or non-English characters
- Input folder should contain only image files (no subfolders)
- Output folder must exist and be empty before processing
- Recommended image size: 500x500 to 2000x2000 pixels

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
- CPU processing only (GPU version requires separate compilation)
- Approximately 1GB memory usage per 1920x1080 image
- Processing time: ~1 minute per 1920x1080 image on i7 processor (20x Faster than most tools alike!)

FEATURES:
- MeshTwist: Prevents AI feature extraction, primarily affects LoRA training
- FGSM Protection: Disrupts AI image analysis and image-to-image generation
- Watermarking: Adds difficult-to-remove watermarks
- Gradient Injection: Interferes with neural network training

NOTES:
- Image transparency will be converted to 100% opacity during processing
- Protection methods are not completely irreversible but increase difficulty for AI usage
- Use the help icons (?) for detailed information about each setting
